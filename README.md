# OOP-Platform-game

This is a platform game made in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The player is a young man trying to visit his girlfriend during quarantine. On his way he needs to avoid the police, the virus and people without masks. He can also collect coins.  
If he runs into a policeman with a blue cap, he loses one life or gives him 5 coins, but if he runs into a policeman with a red cap it is automatically game over.
The player can pass by people while they have their mask on, but if he passes by while the mask is off, he loses one life. 
The player moves left-right by pressing the keys <- and ->, and jumps on platforms by pressing the space bar.
